## Lab Number 7 

First we need to obtain the data

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)

```

Q1. How many rows and columns are in your new data frame named x? What R functions could you use to answer this questions?

```{r}
ncol(x)
nrow(x)
dim(x)
y <- read.csv(url,row.names = 1)
dim(y)
```
Q2. Which approach to solving the ‘row-names problem’ mentioned above do you prefer and why? Is one approach more robust than another under certain circumstances?

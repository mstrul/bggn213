How this webpage was created:

The way `Push` and `Pull` works on R studio is it uses unix commands called git -pull and git -push 

`git add class10.pdf`
`git commit class10.pdf`

First local files were created then edited. Then they were commited. Then pushed. 

You can also perform linux command to perform the creation of PDFS or GFMs by:
